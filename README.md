## Executive Summary
---
In preparation for my graduation from Nashville Software School in Data Analytics cohort 3, I chose to focus my capstone project on the impact of HIV/AIDS on the orphan crisis in Africa. Today, there are millions of orphans in the world, often orphaned due to war, natural disaster, povery, disease, stigma and medical needs. Specifically in Africa, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which arose in the 1980s, has contributed to a significant increase in the number of orphans in the region. While interning at an orphan care organization in college, I learned how few people are aware of the orphan crisis. With this project, my hope is to shed a light on this crisis by specifically looking at how HIV/AIDS has affected Africa's children. For the analysis, I'm using data from ourworldindata.org and databank.worldbank.org, as well as geometry data publicly available from Github. 

The final deliverable for this project is an exploratory and interactive dashboard. It will serve as an educational tool, informing viewers of the orphan crisis and the impact that HIV/AIDS has had specifically on Sub-Saharan African countries.

## Key Definitions
---
What is HIV/AIDS?
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. Left untreated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).

What is an orphan?
The definition of an orphan varies by country, but for the sake of this analysis, an orphan is defined as child of 0-17 years of age who has lost one or both parents.

## Motivation
---
One summer in college, I interned at an orphan care organization called Show Hope, located in Franklin, Tennessee. The organization had two main priorities. The first priority is to address the financial barriers of adoption by providing adoption grants, which range from $25K-$50K, to families who want to adopt. The second priority of the organization is to address the medical barriers of adoption. Many orphaned children are in great need of life-saving medical treatments, so to combat this issue Show Hope offers medical grants to families who may need financial assistance to cover an adopted child's medical costs. During my internship with Show Hope, I learned not only how many children were living without a family, but also the number of barriers that stand in the way of family who wants to adopt. In its efforts to offset healthcare and adoption expenses, Show Hope has made much progress in addressing the orphan crisis but there is still a long way to go. While there are a number of factors that contribute to the orphan crisis, this capstone project is my effort to better understand how the HIV/AIDS epidemic has impacted poverty-stricken countries in Africa that have limited access to resources and education.

## Data Questions
---
1. How has the increase in number of HIV/AIDS cases impacted the number of orphaned children in Africa?

2. Which African countries are seeing the most impact from HIV/AIDS and how has it changed over time?

3. How has HIV/AIDS funding and expenditure changed over time? And is it correlated with the number of HIV/AIDS cases?
 
## Data Sources
---
1. Number of Orphaned children by country: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-children-orphaned-from-aids 

2. Poverty and population by country: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/poverty-and-equity 

3. HIV Expenditure on prevention/treatment by country: https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids

From cleaning up data types and identifying null values or special numbers to "melting" a CSV to mirror other data tables, data cleaning was a key step in the  capstone development process. Another key step was joining the data tables on "country."
